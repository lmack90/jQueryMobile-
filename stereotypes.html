                <h1>Stereotypes</h1>
            </div>

                <div class="main-content" style="margin: 0 40px;">
                  <h2>Let’s talk about stereotypes.</h2>
                  <span>(I know. It can be an awkward conversation.)</span>
                  

                  <p>We’ve all heard some stereotypes that made us cringe. The problem with stereotypes is that whether we realize it or not, they can be automatic and unconscious, influencing the decisions we make about other people. And if we belong to a group that’s been harmed by stereotypes, we might alter our own behaviour to make sure those stereotypes don’t work against us.</p>

                  <p>Stereotypes assume we know something about a person based on the group they belong to, which is an issue at the heart of managing bias in the workplace. This leads us to a topic you may remember well: <b>Performance Bias.</b></p>

                  <p>We also have a Help Center to answer any question any questions you may have down the line.</p>

					    <h3>What is Performance Bias?</h3>
					    <p><code>Performance bias clouds our perception of others’ competence and abilities. We unconsciously assume that certain groups have inherent value, while other groups need to prove that value to us. This means that professionals from under-represented groups may not be given the same opportunities as their peers when it comes to hiring, promotions, and leadership roles. Often, these same professionals are held to stricter or higher standards than those from majority groups. This means we’re losing great talent before we even know it’s there.<br><span>(Kind of like my data when you download the Spotify playlist that’s just Gerry Rafferty’s Baker Street thirty-three times in a row. )</span></code></p>

						<p>A study conducted in 1999 found that a resume with a man’s name is considered “worthy of hire” 79% of the time, but a resume with a woman’s name was only considered 49% of the time. The catch? The resumes were identical, with only the names changed.</p>

						<p>When asked to grade a poorly written legal brief authored by a law student, lawyers gave a significantly higher score if they assumed the student was white. In addition, when the hypothetical student was identified as white, written comments were much more supportive (“needs to focus but has a lot of potential”), than when the student was identified as black (i.e., “I can’t believe he went to NYU.”)</p>
